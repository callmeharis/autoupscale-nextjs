    question: "How old do I need to be to rent a car",
    answer: `With many rental companies, you must be at least 21 years of age to rent a car, and 
    any driver under 25 may have to pay a Young Driver Fee.Similarly, people aged 70+
  may find some companies will charge a Senior Driver Fee, or may not rent to them at 
    all.So car rental for the under-25s or over-70s can be more expensive–which is one more 
    reason to book with Rentalcars.com as we work with all the big brands.Just check each
car’s terms and conditions to see if your age would make any difference`

    question: "Can I book a one-way car rental?",
    answer: `Yes. One-way car rental deals are quite common, as they give people even more 
  freedom to explore and enjoy their rental. However, rental companies will often charge 
  a One Way Fee (or ‘drop charge’) to cover the cost of returning the car to its original 
  location. As the world’s biggest online car rental service, we can help you find a one-
  way rental car with a low Fee – or no Fee at all.`,

    question: "Do I need rental car insurance – and what is ‘CDW’ anyway??",
    answer:
      `Before you buy any car rental insurance, you should find out what coverage is provided 
  by your credit card company, your homeowner’s / renter’s policy, and your own car 
  insurance. This will help you decide what cover you need to buy while booking and 
  picking up your car.
  CDW means ‘Collision Damage Waiver’; a type of cover that limits your liability for 
  damage to certain parts of a rental car.`,
